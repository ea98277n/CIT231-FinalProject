                <h3>Television</h3>
                <p>
                    Digital streaming has revolutionized the way TV is watched. Streaming services such as <b>Hulu</b>, <b>Youtube</b>, and <b>Netflix</b> have made cable bills a thing of the past.
                </p>
                <h3>Movies</h3>
                <p>
                    Several different companies have made going to the movies and trips to BlockBuster a nostalgic memory. Some of these services include <b>Vudu</b>, <b>Netflix</b>, and Amazon's <b>Prime Video</b>.
                </p>
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>
                    Remember that old thing called a radio? It was bulky and required CD's or casettes? Now <b>Spotify</b>, <b>Pandora</b>, and <b>Apple Music</b> make listening to your favorite songs much simpler. Still want the variety of songs you don't know yet? You can still get these through the radio features within these services.
                </p>
                <h3>More</h3>
                <p>
                    Some TVs don't even require a separate piece of hardware to do things like browse the web or play games. Web-enabled Televisions, or Web TVs for short, are becoming more and more popular. No more fancy boxes surrounding your TV. It's all built in.
