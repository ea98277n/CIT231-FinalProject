                    You can't build a house without a foundation. The same rule applies to technology. Back in the day, technology was just starting to evolve, the same way is is right this second. These old machines were the basis for the technology we use daily.
                </p>
                <h3>Now</h3>
                <p>
                    The technology we have now owes much credit to the previous generations of televisions. Older technology paved the way for our new fancy gadgets &dash; fact. If we didn't have that old CRT television, we wouldn't have been able to evolve to the slim LCD and LED displays we have today. Video game consoles probably wouldn't exist because you need the TV to use the console. On-Demand everything would be something people would only dream about had it not been for the modern-day television's predecessors.
