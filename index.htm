                <h3>Past</h3>
                <p>
                    In the past, people used cathode ray tube (CRT) TVs. These TVs were analog and are very much unlike the televisions seen in store most homes today. The TVs had limited functionality, and did not have HD picture quality.
                </p>
                <h3>Present</h3>
                <p>
                    Today, CRT Televisions are a thing of the past and have died out. Most televisions are either LCD or LED. <u>LCD</u> stands for Liquid Crystal Display and <u>LED</u> stands for Light-Emitting Diode. These televisions are much more advanced than the older CRT TVs that it's debatable if they should even be called televisions anymore, but rather <i>displays</i>.

                <p>
                    These displays have many new capabilities that were not previously available, such as High Definition (HD) quality. With the addition of HD video, screen resolutions have become more important. Here are some examples of different resolutions:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <b>Standard-definition Television (SDTV)</b>
                        <li>480i</li>
                        <li>576i</li>
                        <b>Enhanced-definition Television (EDTV)</b>
                        <li>480p</li>
                        <li>576p</li>
                        <b>High-definition Television (HDTV)</b>
                        <li>720p</li>
                        <li>1080i</li>
                        <li>1080p</li>
                        <b>Ultra-high-definition Television (HDTV)</b>
                        <li>2160p</li>
                        <li>4320p</li>
                        <li>8640p</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Future</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many new technologies being released, which have the potential to phase out television all together. Technologies like Google Glass come to mind, along with 3D TVs. 3D TVs may still be televisions, but they're a whole new generation with the way they make television appear like it's coming out of the screen.
